const GridPage = () => {
    return (
        <main>
            <div className="container">
                This is the page with the grid as required. <br />
                When you klik an images it should be displayed in fullscreen <br />
                Should it have 3 options for how to display the images? do this with css<br />
                When we have so many images, should I use some 'lazy loading/fetch'? Lazy=true
            </div>
        </main>
    );
};
 
export default GridPage;
